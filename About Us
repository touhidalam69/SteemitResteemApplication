Lead Developer Touhidalam by sheer accident discovered the power of a ReSteem and decided to create a fantastic project out of 
that accidental discovery. He was keen on sharing the importance to the world through this open source project.

SteemitResteemApplication was further worked on as a project to help people harness the awesome power of resteeming and 
helping relevant information go viral.  

This app helps people do it with little or no stress, automatically. Where they just resteem posts from selected users or 
selected Tags, isnâ€™t that awesome?. Sharing great information to your followers by using this app to automatically resteem 
post from your favourite author or brand on steemit.

SteemitResteemApplication while helping people automatically resteem will also invest time in teaching people how to use this 
project and not abuse the awesome power a resteem.
